Pollinator is a Python package that uses select/poll with generators to ease the
development of simple non-blocking network services, avoiding any need for threading.
Along with the core code are implementations of a simple HTTP server and netstring-based
RPC code for client and server.

This code is under early development and will centralize utility code already present
in the "taskforce" and "rainbarrel" packages.
